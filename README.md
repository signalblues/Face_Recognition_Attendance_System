# Face_Recognition_Attendance_System
This is a Face Recognition based Attendance Monitoring System built in Python 2.7. The system creates a database of students by clicking 20 pics of each of their faces and storing them under the names of the respective student. Then the system is capable of recognizing them in real time. Once some or all of these students are sitting in a class, the system can track their faces and generate a CSV file stating which student is present and who is absent by entering a 'P' or an 'A' against each of their names.
